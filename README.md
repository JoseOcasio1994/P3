# Developer's Diary

**Week 2**

Established proposal - create a controller using arduino, which will be a platform
that a user can sit/lie down on and, using 6-axis motion sensors, use their body
to fly in VR.

Planning the design - Used Fritzing to plan visually what the Arduino setup might look like, or
at least how the wiring will be done.
