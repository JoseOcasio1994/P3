# Developer's Diary

**Week 2**

Established proposal - create a controller using arduino, which will be a platform
that a user can sit/lie down on and, using 6-axis motion sensors, use their body
to fly in VR.

Planning the design - Used Fritzing to plan visually what the Arduino setup might look like, or
at least how the wiring will be done.

**Week 3**

*Day 1* - Created a project in Unreal and setup the control scheme. Mouse axis controls rotation of Airplane, Arduino will simulate Mouse axis controls. 
Left/Right mouse buttons for firing, Vive controls to be added to replace mouse for shooting.

*Day 2* - Developed a scene for the flight simulation (buildings, targets, and a score manager).

*Day 3* - Started designing the code for the Arduino (Connect to bluetooth, read 
Gyroscope raw data, convert Gyroscope data to Mouse x/y axis, send to PC via bluetooth).
